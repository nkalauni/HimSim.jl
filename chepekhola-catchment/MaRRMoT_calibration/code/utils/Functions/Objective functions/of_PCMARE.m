function [val,idx] = of_PCMARE(obs,sim,idx)
% of_MARE Calculates a version of the Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE)
% of simulated streamflow as a percentage of the MARE of the mean 
% observed flow. Ignores time steps with negative flow values.  Adds a
% constant e of 1/100 of mean(obs) to avoid issues with zero flows 
% (Pushpalatha et al., 2012).
